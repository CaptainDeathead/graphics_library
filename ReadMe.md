 
 This is just a little project I work on 
 in my free time. Mainly for easy access 
 in the future but it'll (Hopefully)become 
 publically available at some point. I 
 based this library on a project I did 
 in early 2023 and now it's here. 
 
 Why I made it and what it's for? 
 I decided to make this library/module 
 because I wanted an easy-to-use 
 intuitive 3d rendering library that
 was minimalistic and was easy to 
 interact with. you could render the
 output triangles to virtually any 
 viewport in python3.

 Documentation:
 Not available yet as the software's
 in a fluid developmental state right
 now(10th Febuary 2024). If this
 repository hasn't been updated in 6-12 
 months it's safe to assume it's been
 forgoton about so good luck...

 Happy Coding!
