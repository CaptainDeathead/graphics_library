#  This is just a litte project I work on     #
#  in my free time. Mainly for easy access    #
#  in the futre but it'll (Hopefully)become   #
#  publically available at some point. I      #
#  based this library off a project i did     #
#  in early 2023 and now it's here.           #
#                                             #
#  Why I made it and what it's for?           #
#  I decided to make this library/module      #
#  because i wanted an easy to use            #
#  intuative 3d rendering library that        #
#  was minimalistic and was easy to           #
#  interact with. you could render the        #
#  output triangles to virtually any          #
#  viewport in python3.                       #
#                                             #
#  Documentation:                             #
#  Not available yet as the software's        #
#  in a fluid develepmental state right       #
#  now(10th Febuary 2024). If this            #
#  repositry hasn't been updated in 6-12      #
#  months it's safe to assume it's been       #
#  forgoten about so good luck...             #
